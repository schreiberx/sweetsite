This page provides an overview of tutorials with SWEET

**WARNING**: SWEET is still undergoing some changes. Therefore, some tutorials might not work. We'd be very interested in getting informed about this to fix it!


## Installation

 * [Installing required packages](installation/basics.html)


## Basic steps with SWEET

 * [Command line compilation & running](basic/swe_sphere_cmd_line.html)

 * [Using graphical user interface](basic/swe_sphere_with_gui.html)

 * [Postprocessing data](basic/postprocessing.html)

 * [Convergence benchmark with reference job](basic/swe_sphere_convergence_with_reference_job.html)

## From program arguments to their utilization

Each program can have **different variables** which are modified by particular **program arguments**.
Hence, we need to be able to do this individually for each program which is explained right here.

 * [Program argument class](classDict/programArguments.html)
 
 * [Class dictionary](classDict/classDict.html)
